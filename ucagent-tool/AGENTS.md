# AGENTS.md

This file contains repository-level instructions for coding agents working on
UCAgent. It applies to the entire repository unless a more specific AGENTS.md is
added below a subdirectory.

## Project Goal

UCAgent is a Python 3.11+ AI agent for hardware verification. It combines:

- configuration-driven verification workflows;
- stages and stage lifecycle management;
- deterministic checkers that gate stage completion;
- local and MCP-exposed tools;
- runtime Guide_Doc files, output templates, and optional skills;
- UnityChip/toffee tests, coverage, Bug analysis, and waveform evidence.

The main engineering objective is not merely to make an LLM produce output. The
system must prevent incomplete DUT specifications, invalid verification results,
and fabricated evidence from being accepted.

## Repository Map

- `ucagent/verify_agent.py`: top-level agent assembly and runtime initialization.
- `ucagent/cli.py`, `ucagent.py`: installed and source-tree CLI entry points.
- `ucagent/setting.yaml`: global defaults, backends, tools, launch settings, and
  environment-backed defaults.
- `ucagent/util/config.py`: layered config loading, overrides, template handling,
  and the shared `.ucagent/runtime_config.json` snapshot.
- `ucagent/stage/`: `VerifyStage`, `StageManager`, Check/Complete lifecycle, stage
  history, and stage tools.
- `ucagent/checkers/`: deterministic validation and batch-task implementations.
- `ucagent/tools/`: LLM tools, file/test operations, MCP conversion, skills, and
  waveform analysis.
- `ucagent/abackend/`: LangChain and command-line backend adapters.
- `ucagent/server/`, `ucagent/tui/`: master APIs, terminals, web UI, and TUI.
- `ucagent/lang/zh/config/default.yaml`: the main UnityTest workflow, system
  prompts, stage tasks, checker wiring, and stage-local skills.
- `ucagent/lang/zh/doc/Guide_Doc/`: runtime guidance copied into a DUT workspace.
- `ucagent/lang/zh/template/`: files rendered into a DUT workspace.
- `ucagent/lang/zh/skills/`: skills copied to `<workspace>/.ucagent/skills` when
  skill support is enabled.
- `docs/content/`: developer/user documentation for the MkDocs site. This is not
  the same as runtime `Guide_Doc`.
- `tests/`: unit and focused regression tests.
- `examples/`: example DUT inputs and, in some cases, generated verification
  artifacts. Do not treat generated example outputs as canonical source.

## Working Tree Discipline

- Assume the worktree may already contain important user changes. Inspect
  `git status --short` and the relevant diff before editing.
- Never revert, normalize, or reformat unrelated changes. Some files use CRLF and
  some use LF; preserve the existing file's line endings.
- Keep patches scoped by feature. Do not combine prompt rewrites, checker changes,
  server refactors, and unrelated cleanup unless the task requires all of them.
- Do not edit generated `output/`, DUT workspaces, waveform files, `.ucagent`
  checkpoints, or stage-history repositories unless the task explicitly targets
  generated/runtime state.
- Do not run broad destructive Make targets such as `make clean`, `reset_%`, or
  `clean_%` in a shared worktree without explicit authorization. They remove
  outputs, waveforms, checkpoints, and generated workspaces.
- Do not create a commit unless explicitly requested. When requested, group
  commits by coherent feature and use clear English commit messages.

## Configuration Contract

Configuration is loaded in this order:

1. `ucagent/setting.yaml`
2. `~/.ucagent/setting.yaml`
3. `ucagent/lang/<lang>/config/default.yaml`
4. workspace `.ucagent/setting.yaml`
5. the explicitly selected config file, usually `config.yaml`
6. CLI/config overrides

Important rules:

- `$(NAME: default)` is resolved while YAML is loaded. Negated boolean scalars
  such as `not $(IGNORE_X: true)` use `UCAgentConfigLoader`.
- Config lists are replaced as lists; they are not merged item-by-item. A custom
  `stage:` override generally needs the complete intended stage list.
- `{DUT}`, `{OUT}`, `{WORKSPACE}`, and other template values are rendered after
  config loading. Do not confuse template substitution with environment
  substitution.
- Runtime code must consume resolved `agent.cfg`, not re-read an environment
  variable that originally supplied a config default.
- After template resolution, `VerifyAgent` writes the non-secret shared snapshot
  `<workspace>/.ucagent/runtime_config.json`. External scripts and other runtime
  consumers should use `load_runtime_config(workspace)`.
- The runtime snapshot must include `ucagent_python_path`: an absolute Python
  import root containing the exact running `ucagent` package. Derive it from the
  loaded package location, not the current directory, repository name, an
  environment variable, or an assumed installation layout. Validate that the
  path contains `ucagent/__init__.py`; an absent, relative, or stale path must
  fail with an instruction to restart UCAgent and regenerate the snapshot.
- Keep secrets out of runtime snapshots, prompts, logs, checker results, and test
  fixtures. Never dump the full config because it can contain API keys/tokens.
- When adding a runtime option, define a positive, unambiguous field under
  `runtime_options`, validate its type, persist only if safe, document it, and
  test both enabled and disabled configurations.
- Always parse modified YAML in representative environment combinations. This is
  especially important for booleans, nested stages, Markdown fences, and strings
  containing `{}`.

Current test-fixture contract:

- `runtime_options.need_ref_model: false` -> ordinary DUT tests use `env`.
- `runtime_options.need_ref_model: true` -> ordinary DUT tests use
  `env, ref_model` in that order.
- `runtime_options.mock_components_enabled: true` does not change ordinary DUT
  test signatures.
- independent Mock tests use only `mock_dut` and the
  `test_api_{DUT}_mock_*` naming convention.

## Stage and Checker Lifecycle

`VerifyStage` constructs a checker, injects `cfg`, then calls
`set_workspace(...).set_stage(...)`. `StageManager` is attached later, and the
active stage eventually calls each checker's `on_init()`.

Follow these rules when implementing checkers:

- Every Checker subclass with a custom `__init__` must call
  `super().__init__()` before registering lifecycle callbacks or constructing a
  `UnityChipBatchTask`. `Checker._cb_list` is an instance-only registry; do not
  add class-level callback storage, lazy initialization, or test-time resets.
- Keep `__init__` limited to validating/storing constructor parameters and
  creating lightweight helper objects. Do not scan workspace files or derive
  live task state in the constructor.
- Perform real workspace/stage-dependent initialization in `on_init()`. Call
  `super().on_init()` after the subclass has prepared its cached state.
- Do not assume `stage_manager` exists during construction or the initial
  `set_stage` callback.
- `get_template_data()` is a read-only projection of cached state. It must not
  scan files, update lists, advance a batch, write checkpoints, or otherwise
  change behavior. It may be called repeatedly while rendering descriptions.
- `do_check(is_complete=False, **kwargs)` performs live validation and returns
  `(bool, str|dict|list)`. Prefer structured, concise, actionable diagnostics.
- A Checker owns failure diagnosis. When a failure can be repaired
  deterministically, return an explicit diagnostic mapping containing at least
  `error_code`, `error`, and `next_action`, plus bounded `observed`, `expected`,
  artifact, and location fields where useful. The bounded Checker result may be
  the diagnostic itself; when the result also carries raw output, put the
  bounded mapping under `diagnostic`. Stage management may project this contract
  into `failure_summary` and add stage/Checker identity metadata, but must
  preserve all Checker-authored diagnostic fields and must not infer or
  synthesize a summary from ordinary `error`, `details`, `STDOUT`, or `STDERR`
  fields.
- When a Checker does not provide a complete explicit diagnostic, Check and
  Complete must preserve its entire original result. The reserved boolean
  `stage_args.full_output` requests the original result even when an explicit
  diagnostic normally permits compact output; consume this field before
  dispatching the remaining stage arguments to Checkers.
- Every overridden `do_check` must have a meaningful docstring. `Checker.__str__`
  asserts that this description exists during stage-info generation.
- A failed checker must explain the exact failing artifact, the relevant current
  batch/item, and the next corrective action. Do not return only an internal
  boolean or a generic "checker failed" message.
- Do not trust LLM-authored progress markers by themselves. Cross-check markers
  against source files, generated artifacts, current configuration, and any
  signed/persisted tool evidence.
- Keep Check and Complete semantics distinct: Check may finish one batch and
  expose the next; Complete succeeds only when all work and final validation are
  complete.
- Export a new checker from `ucagent/checkers/__init__.py` when its short class
  name is referenced by `clss` in YAML.

## Batch Checker Rules

Use `UnityChipBatchTask` for staged batch work rather than implementing a second
checkpoint/progress engine.

- Set `checker.batch_size` before constructing `UnityChipBatchTask`.
- Preserve and reconcile `source_task_list`, `gen_task_list`, `tbd_task_list`,
  and `cmp_task_list`.
- Treat the current source files/documents as ground truth. Checkpoints support
  resume; they do not override changed source data.
- Re-derive source/generated completion state in `on_init()` or `do_check()` as
  appropriate, then use `sync_source_task()` and `sync_gen_task()`.
- Remove or invalidate stale tasks after source changes. Unknown, duplicate, or
  forged progress must fail rather than silently skip work.
- Use `UnityChipBatchTask.do_complete()` for batch transitions and completion
  semantics. It also resets the stage's consecutive-failure counter after a
  successful batch.
- Fail clearly when the source task list is empty because of an invalid path or
  configuration. Do not silently report completion.
- Keep LLM output compact. Summarize missing ranges/items by block and include
  only bounded excerpts; advise reading the source file when the excerpt is
  incomplete.

For functional line mapping specifically:

- `file_list` is the authoritative file set; do not infer or duplicate a parent
  stage's references at runtime.
- Do not pass `Guide_Doc` files into the line-map checker.
- Cover every nonblank physical source line with an FG/FC/CK mapping or a
  reasoned `IGNORE` mapping.
- Use file/line blocks no larger than 100 physical lines and validate progress
  against the actual mapping files.

## Tool and MCP Rules

- Prefer `UCTool` for new LLM-callable tools.
- Give every tool a unique `name`, a precise `description`, and a Pydantic
  `BaseModel` `args_schema` with useful `Field` descriptions.
- MCP conversion requires a `BaseModel` schema and does not support LangChain
  injected arguments. Test local invocation and MCP-schema conversion.
- Export a new built-in tool from `ucagent/tools/__init__.py` if configs should
  refer to it by short name.
- Resolve workspace-relative paths safely. Do not let tool arguments escape the
  configured workspace or bypass read/write directory restrictions.
- Return structured data when the LLM must reuse fields. Include detailed
  diagnostics for lookup failures: searched paths, available candidates,
  likely naming mismatches, prerequisites, and a concrete next call.
- For long calls, use UCTool progress/heartbeat support rather than appearing
  hung. Respect timeout and re-entry behavior.
- If a checker must prove that a tool was really called, persist a verifiable
  receipt or equivalent evidence and validate/replay it. Never accept document
  text as proof of invocation.
- When adding a dependency, update both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`
  with compatible constraints, then add focused tests for missing dependency,
  empty data, malformed data, and successful use.

## Runtime Docs, Templates, and Skills

These layers form one behavioral contract and often must change together:

1. `ucagent/lang/zh/config/default.yaml` task/system prompts
2. `ucagent/lang/zh/doc/Guide_Doc/*` runtime user guidance
3. `ucagent/lang/zh/template/*` generated-file skeletons
4. `ucagent/lang/zh/skills/*/SKILL.md` and skill scripts
5. checker/parser implementation
6. focused tests

Do not change only one layer when a format or mandatory behavior changes.

### LLM-Facing Content

LLM-facing content includes system/stage/task prompts, rendered stage
descriptions, checker diagnostics, tool descriptions and argument fields, tool
results, runtime `Guide_Doc`, templates, and skill instructions.

- Write from the perspective of the agent executing the current stage. State the
  objective, usable inputs and actions, required artifacts/formats/evidence,
  acceptance criteria, and the concrete next action.
- Do not expose UCAgent architecture or implementation details that do not
  change the LLM's valid next action. Avoid Python class/module names, object
  lifecycle and call order, checker internals, checkpoint/state storage,
  configuration assembly, backend/MCP/server wiring, private data structures,
  and enforcement rationale.
- Preserve public runtime interfaces the LLM must actually use, including tool
  names and arguments, workspace paths, tags and schemas, stage commands,
  constraints, and validation results. Present them as task contracts, not as
  explanations of how UCAgent implements or enforces them.
- Translate internal failures into task-oriented diagnostics: identify the
  affected artifact/input and location, the expected condition, the observed
  problem, and the exact corrective action or next tool call. Do not expose
  stack traces, internal booleans, or call chains unless the text is explicitly
  for developer debugging rather than the stage-running LLM.
- Keep LLM-facing text concise and stage-local. Remove background information
  that cannot influence the current stage's decisions, output, or completion.
- Describe only the current canonical contract. Do not mention superseded
  formats, migrations, backward compatibility, removed arguments, or what older
  releases accepted unless the current task explicitly requires migration work.
  When input has the wrong shape, state the required current structure and the
  exact repair action without teaching the LLM about historical alternatives.

### Current-Contract-Only Development

During active development, the repository targets only the latest canonical
contract. Backward compatibility with superseded development contracts is not a
goal unless the current task explicitly requests a bounded migration.

- Implement the latest contract directly. Do not retain old aliases, argument
  names, configuration fields, environment-variable fallbacks, tool schemas,
  checker classes, tag formats, document layouts, parser branches, or prompt
  instructions as compatibility paths.
- When a contract is replaced, remove the superseded implementation and its
  fallback or auto-conversion logic in the same change. Invalid old input must
  fail with the current expected format and corrective action; it must not be
  silently accepted, guessed, translated, or normalized.
- Synchronize every affected contract layer: resolved configuration, runtime
  code, prompts, `Guide_Doc`, templates, skills and scripts, contract files,
  tests, fixtures, and maintained examples. Delete stale fixtures and examples
  that exist only for the superseded contract.
- Tests must construct and assert the current canonical contract. If a test
  fails because it imports a removed interface or expects superseded behavior,
  update or delete that test; do not restore the old production interface to
  make the test pass.
- Existing generated workspaces, copied skills, checkpoints, reports, and
  `output/` artifacts do not justify compatibility code. Regenerate or restart
  them against the latest contract instead of teaching runtime code to consume
  stale development artifacts.
- Before finishing a contract change, search the repository for removed names,
  paths, tags, fields, and examples, and verify that no reachable compatibility
  branch or conflicting normative guidance remains.

### Shared Runtime Contract

- Tagged Markdown is a machine-readable interface. Treat FG/FC/CK, BG/TC,
  FILE/LINK-BUG, progress markers, and fenced evidence blocks like an API.
- Keep one canonical format instead of accepting several ambiguous variants.
- In runtime Markdown, templates, Skill assets, and Markdown examples, surround
  every ATX heading (`#` through `######`) with a blank line. Every heading must
  have a preceding blank line without exception, including a heading at the
  beginning of a file, the first heading inside a Markdown fence, and a heading
  after a machine anchor `<a id="..."></a>`. Do not place a paragraph, list,
  table, another heading, opening/closing fence, or anchor directly before a
  heading. Canonical machine companion markers such as `<BUG-*>`, `<ROOT-*>`,
  and `<RELATED-BUGS>` may remain immediately after their field headings.
  Markdown-generating scripts and renderers must preserve the same spacing in
  their generated output.
- The dynamic Bug document target is exactly
  `{OUT}/{DUT}_bug_analysis.md`; its visible Markdown title is not a filename
  rule. Do not derive or create another output filename from that title.
- Serialize one exact report node ID according to its consumer: dynamic
  Markdown uses `- {visible_title} <TC-{exact_report_node_id}>`; recorder/Apply
  arguments and waveform YAML `test_case` use
  `TC-{exact_report_node_id}`; WaveInfo `test_case_name` uses
  `{exact_report_node_id}`. These forms differ only by the required Markdown
  wrapper and `TC-` prefix; the node ID itself is byte-for-byte identical.
- When no dynamic Bug is found, retain the canonical document title and the
  three ordered sections, with empty closed `DYNAMIC-BUGS`, `ROOT-CAUSES`, and
  `WAVEFORM-EVIDENCE` bodies. Do not put explanatory prose, TC/BG placeholders,
  ROOT entities, or waveform records inside those empty containers.
- Every normative `Guide_Doc` file must include a complete canonical reference
  example for its primary artifact contract. The example must show the entire
  finished artifact from its title through its closing section, including exact
  section order, heading levels, tag nesting, fences, required fields, and
  representative completed content. Additional complete examples or focused
  branch examples may cover alternate required branches. Small fragments may
  explain individual rules, but they do not replace the complete example. Keep
  the example synchronized with prompts, generated templates, optional skill
  assets and scripts, checkers, and focused regression tests so the LLM is not
  left to invent alternate titles or layouts.
- Keep examples syntactically valid, visually readable in Markdown, and exactly
  consistent with checker expectations.
- In LLM-facing content, qualify every Guide_Doc section reference with its
  runtime-relative file path, for example
  `Guide_Doc/dut_bug_analysis.md section 5.1`. Never use a bare reference such
  as `Guide section 5.1` or `section 5.1` when directing the LLM to a document.

### Optional Skill Contract

- Skill support is optional. Every workflow and stage must remain executable and
  checker-completable when skills are disabled and when `.ucagent/skills` is
  absent.
- Treat a skill as an acceleration or guidance path, never as the sole source of
  mandatory behavior. The stage prompt, runtime guidance, tool contracts, and
  templates available without skills must still expose every required objective,
  input, output format, evidence rule, and completion criterion.
- Make skill references in task prompts conditional and provide an actionable
  non-skill path using the normally available tools and source files. Do not
  unconditionally instruct the LLM to read a skill, call a skill-only tool, run
  a skill script, or stop because a skill is unavailable.
- Skill-enabled and skill-disabled paths must produce the same canonical
  artifacts and meet the same checker standards. Disabling skills must not skip
  work, weaken evidence, or relax validation.
- Any requirement to invoke a skill or validate skill-use evidence must be
  conditional on the resolved skill setting. It must not block Check or Complete
  when skills are disabled.
- Check Skill usage only when Skill support is enabled and the current stage
  has a nonempty stage-level `skill_list`. A missing or empty `skill_list` must
  not expose Skill status, require `SetSkillUsage`, or gate Check/Complete. A
  nonempty stage-level `skill_list` requires complete Skill usage evidence by
  default. An explicit `force_use_skill: false` makes
  that stage's Skills optional. `general_skill_list` entries are always optional
  and never enter the stage requirement. The evidence gate applies to
  `Complete`, not intermediate `Check` calls. When Skill support is disabled,
  the gate is inactive even if a stage declares `skill_list`. For each forced
  Skill, `SetSkillUsage` must validate real `listed=true` and `read=true`
  evidence, followed by either `used=true` for an applied method or
  `used=false` with a nonempty no-applicable-work reason after a passing current
  `Check`. A reason cannot create list/read evidence, replace `Check`, downgrade
  observed use=true, or manufacture a Bug/artifact. A forced gate failure must
  identify each Skill and its current `listed`/`read`/`used` state, plus the
  exact `SetSkillUsage` call to make after performing any missing actions.
- Skill directories require `SKILL.md` with valid `name` and `description`
  frontmatter. Keep a skill concise and put deterministic repeated work in
  `scripts/`.
- Skill scripts execute with the DUT workspace as the current directory. Read
  resolved runtime configuration from `.ucagent/runtime_config.json`; do not
  reinterpret feature environment variables.
- Python Skill scripts that import `ucagent` must run through `RunSkillScript`.
  Before starting the child process, `RunSkillScript` must load
  `ucagent_python_path` from `.ucagent/runtime_config.json`, place it first in
  the child `PYTHONPATH` without duplicating it, and preserve other import paths.
  This contract must work both for an installed package and direct source-tree
  execution; do not require a separate UCAgent installation or infer the source
  root from the copied Skill script's location.
- A nonempty `scripts/__init__.py` can install `setup_vstage` hooks. Avoid hidden
  import-time side effects and make hooks idempotent.
- Skills are copied into a workspace at agent initialization. Source changes do
  not automatically update an already-running workspace; restart/recopy before
  diagnosing stale skill behavior.
- For every skill-related workflow change, test both enabled and disabled
  configurations. The disabled case must cover an absent skill directory and
  must verify that rendered prompts, available actions, checker behavior, and
  completion do not depend on skill-only content.

## Verification Domain Invariants

Preserve these established semantics unless the task explicitly changes them:

- Empty test templates intentionally end with
  `assert False, "Not implemented"`. Implemented tests must remove that
  placeholder and use real assertions.
- Validation infrastructure failures (test code, fixtures, API, reference model,
  Mock behavior, reset/timing, dependencies) must be fixed to Pass. They are not
  DUT Bugs.
- A correctly written test that reproducibly exposes a DUT defect must remain
  Fail and be recorded with the required Bug evidence. Do not weaken assertions
  to make it Pass.
- Static candidates use `BG-STATIC-*` only in
  `{DUT}_static_bug_analysis.md`. A dynamically reproduced Bug gets a separate
  non-static BG tag in `{DUT}_bug_analysis.md`.
- Dynamic Bug entries require real WaveInfo evidence for every associated TC.
  Each TC must be immediately followed by a canonical `<WAVEFORM-REF>` link to
  its unique record in the document-level `<WAVEFORM-EVIDENCE>` section. The
  record's fenced `yaml` block must have `waveform_analysis` as its sole
  top-level key, name every associated BG, and contain a verifiable receipt.
- A verified signed waveform receipt and central record remain valid when later
  Checks rotate sessions or remove the original waveform file. Ordinary Checks
  must not replay or refresh historical evidence. Only a gate configured with
  `require_current_replay=true` may require current waveform replay and
  atomically refresh semantically equivalent machine evidence. A cached-report
  document preflight always uses `require_current_replay=false`; it may reject a
  malformed document but must never run tests, refresh evidence, or complete a
  batch.
- A `require_current_replay=true` gate must replay all unique documented TCs in
  one Check. It must batch and atomically refresh every semantically unchanged
  record without LLM work. If signed semantic inputs changed, return the complete
  bounded review queue in one diagnostic and use `ReviewWaveInfoEvidenceBatch`
  to prepare all current contexts and atomically apply all completed reviews.
  Do not expose only one changed TC per Check, require repeated full-test reruns
  between review items, or send the LLM through individual Apply calls. A batch
  item failure must leave the original document unchanged and identify the exact
  item. A concurrent target-document change is a batch-level conflict: preserve
  that external content and report the document scope instead of blaming one TC.
- A waveform Markdown anchor is the stable 16-hex SHA-256-derived identity of
  the canonical TC tag. It is not the 32-hex signed `receipt_id`, must not change
  when evidence is refreshed, and must never be supplied as an Apply receipt.
- A failed TC has exactly one central waveform record even when it is associated
  with multiple Bugs. The signed signal groups must cover the union of each
  associated BG's `required_signals`.
- Within each dynamic `<BG-*>`, list every `<TC-*>` and its immediately following
  `<WAVEFORM-REF>` before the three ordered `<BUG-*>` analysis fields. The fields
  begin only after the final TC/reference pair; never append another TC after the
  first analysis field. Each field uses its canonical level-six visible title,
  then its matching `<BUG-*>` marker on the next nonempty line, then its body.
- Each dynamic BG contains only `<BUG-OVERVIEW>`, `<BUG-SYMPTOMS>`, and
  `<BUG-TRIGGER>`. Its trigger ends with exactly one clickable
  `<CAUSE-REF-ROOT-*>` reference. Each BG references exactly one root cause.
- Define root causes once in the document-level `<ROOT-CAUSES>` section. Every
  root entity has a document-wide unique `<ROOT-*>` tag, the five ordered ROOT
  analysis fields, and at least one clickable `<RELATED-BUG-FG-*/FC-*/CK-*/BG-*>`
  reverse reference. Every referenced BG must exist and both directions must
  agree. A root cause may own multiple BG paths; a combination defect is its own
  root cause.
- A no-Bug result must remain valid without manufacturing waveform evidence.
- Test log cycle values and wavekit steps may differ by zero or several cycles.
  Align evidence by clock occurrence and transaction context; never assume they
  are identical indexes.
- Keep Bug-specific conclusions in the BG entry and the matching central
  `bug_evidence` item. Keep shared receipt, viewer, alignment, and signals only
  in the TC's central waveform record.

## Code Style and Scope

- Match nearby style; the repository is not uniformly autoformatted.
- Keep implementations concise and remove redundant code. Do not introduce an
  abstraction merely to claim reuse or make the implementation look layered.
- A helper function with exactly one call site is unnecessary. Inline its logic
  at that call site instead of retaining a one-use helper.
- Every source file must have a meaningful module/file docstring, and every
  function and class must have a meaningful docstring describing its contract.
  Add succinct comments at critical non-obvious lifecycle, concurrency,
  security, state-transition, or parsing logic; do not narrate obvious code.
- Implement feature behavior as a general contract that covers the real problem
  domain. Do not accumulate ad hoc branches, special cases, fixture-specific
  exceptions, or one-off patches for only the observed example or latest request.
- Self-test every distinct feature point and its important failure boundaries.
  Run sufficient focused and proportional regression tests before stating that
  the implementation is correct, complete, or has no remaining problems.
- Use UTF-8. Files in `ucagent/lang/zh/` may contain Chinese. Do not put Chinese
  literals in generic implementation Python files outside the language tree,
  including Unicode escapes that decode to Chinese at runtime. When generic
  Python needs localized titles, templates, prompt text, or diagnostic guidance,
  load them from the matching `ucagent/lang/<lang>/` resource instead of
  duplicating them in Python.
- Keep generic checker and tool diagnostics language-neutral. Refer to stable
  field keys, machine tags, and exact Guide_Doc paths; do not embed or echo a
  locale's full display-title list into generic runtime messages.
- Prefer standard parsers and structured data over ad hoc string replacement.
- Preserve public constructor arguments and defaults unless compatibility is
  explicitly out of scope.
- Keep user-facing checker/tool errors concise enough for an LLM context window.
  Do not emit every uncovered line when a merged range conveys the same result.

## Testing Strategy

Start with the smallest tests that cover the changed behavior, then broaden by
risk. Typical commands:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile path/to/changed.py tests/test_changed_area.py
pytest -q tests/test_changed_area.py
git diff --check
```

Useful focused suites:

- config/runtime prompts: `tests/test_config_loader.py`,
  `tests/test_waveform_prompt_config.py`,
  `tests/test_unitytest_skill_runtime_options.py`
- stages and batches: `tests/test_stage_manager.py`,
  `tests/test_file_linemap_batch_checker.py`, and the relevant
  `tests/test_unity_*_checker.py`
- tools/MCP/waveforms: `tests/test_waveform_tool.py`,
  `tests/test_mcp_waveinfo_visibility.py`, `tests/test_mcps.py`
- Bug formats/checkers: `tests/test_toffee_report_waveform_analysis.py`,
  `tests/test_toffee_report_mark_diagnostics.py`,
  `tests/test_dynamic_bug_record_scripts.py`, `tests/test_static_bug.py`
- server/TUI/backend changes: the matching `tests/test_api_*`,
  `tests/test_messages_panel*`, `tests/test_cmdline_backend.py`, or
  `tests/test_verify_pdb_runtime.py`

Testing caveats:

- Do not use bare `pytest` as the only completion gate. It also collects tests
  under `examples/` and unrendered template files, causing module-name collisions,
  missing generated DUT imports, and template syntax errors.
- Some historical tests depend on absent generated examples, optional packages,
  or older lifecycle/line-number behavior. Re-check the current baseline before
  treating a broad-suite failure as a regression.
- A baseline issue does not excuse failures in tests directly related to the
  files you changed. Report unrelated broad-suite failures explicitly rather
  than hiding or "fixing" them outside scope.
- Use `tmp_path`/temporary workspaces for tests. Do not rely on or mutate the
  repository's `output/` directory.
- For documentation changes, run `mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml --strict` when
  documentation dependencies are installed.
- For YAML workflow changes, load the file under every affected boolean/config
  combination and verify that checker classes instantiate with the supplied
  arguments.

## Definition of Done

Before handing off a change:

- confirm behavior against the actual surrounding implementation, not only docs;
- synchronize prompts, Guide_Doc, templates, skills, checkers, and tests where
  the contract crosses those layers;
- verify config values come from resolved cfg at runtime;
- run focused tests and proportionate regression tests;
- run Python compilation and `git diff --check`;
- inspect the final diff for unrelated churn, secrets, generated files, and
  accidental line-ending changes;
- state what passed and what could not be run, including exact residual risks;
- leave the worktree uncommitted unless the user explicitly requested commits.
