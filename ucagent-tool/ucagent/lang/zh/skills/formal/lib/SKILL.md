# Formal Shared Library

Markdown formatting contract: every generated ATX heading (`#` through `######`) is surrounded by a blank line. Every heading must have a preceding blank line, including the first line of a document or Markdown example and a heading after a machine anchor `<a id="..."></a>`. A paragraph, list, table, nested heading, opening/closing fence, or anchor must not directly precede a heading. Machine field markers may remain immediately after their field headings.

This is an internal packaging skill.

It exists so the workspace skill copy step includes this directory and makes the shared helpers under `formal/lib/` available to the other formal skills.

Do not select this skill for standalone task execution unless you are specifically maintaining the shared formal helper library.
